# Build-a-Celestial-Bodies-Database

# Project Overview
This project involves creating a relational database that contains multiple tables representing various types of celestial bodies. The goal is to learn how to create, structure, and query a database using PostgreSQL.

# The database will allow for the storage of information like:

    - Stars: Attributes include star names, sizes, types, and distances from Earth.
    - Planets: Includes information about planets such as size, distance from their star, and whether they have moons.
    - Moons: Data about moons orbiting planets.
    - Galaxies: Information on different galaxies, their size, and their location.
    This project uses PostgreSQL to model the relationships between celestial bodies and their attributes.

# Features
Relational Database Structure: The database includes several related tables such as stars, planets, moons, and galaxies.
SQL Queries: You can query the database to find celestial objects based on different attributes such as size, distance, or galaxy.
Normalization: The database schema is normalized to avoid redundant data and ensure consistency.

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following:

PostgreSQL version 16.3 or later installed.
PostgreSQL client tool like pgAdmin or the psql command-line tool.
